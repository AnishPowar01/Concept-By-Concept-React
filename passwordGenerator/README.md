# React Password Generator

Welcome to the React Password Generator project! This is a simple web application built using React.js that allows you to generate random passwords with custom settings.

## Features

- Generate random passwords with a custom length.
- Option to include numbers in the generated password.
- Option to include special characters in the generated password.
- Copy generated passwords to the clipboard with one click.

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the use of several important React concepts:

- **useState**: Used to manage the application's state, including the password generation settings and generated passwords.
- **useCallback**: Utilized for memoizing functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useEffect**: Used to handle side effects, such as copying the generated password to the clipboard.
- **useRef**: Employed to create references to DOM elements, enabling easier access to the password text for copying.
